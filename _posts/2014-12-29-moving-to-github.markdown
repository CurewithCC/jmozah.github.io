Inspired by [Andrew Karpathy's](http://karpathy.github.io/2014/07/01/switching-to-jekyll/) blog about jekyll, i am moving my blog to jekyll today. I also like the idea of storing the blog and hosting automatically in github. 

This might come in handly for [Markups](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Look at Andrew's blog on how to instructions if you also like this idea.

Happy Blogging :-)
